<h3> <strong>About us</strong> </h3>
<p>
    We are a team of linguistics students from HSE University passionate about language and technology. This website is part of our educational project in the Bachelor's program in Fundamental and Computational Linguistics. Gleb Bubnov worked on the backend, Veronika Tsareva on the frontend, with guidance from our supervisors, Anton Buzanov and Maxim Bazhukov.

<h3> <strong>About this site</strong> </h3>
<p>
    <strong>Sample</strong> is a subset of languages that typologists use to study cross-linguistic variation. There are two types of samples that pursue different goals. The first type, <strong>variety sample</strong>, is aimed to capture all the linguistic diversity. In other words, this sample is used to study what language <strong>can</strong> do. The second one, <strong>probability sample</strong>, deals with statistical testing of tendencies and correlations. Otherwise spoken, one should use this sample to study what language is <strong>more likely</strong> to do.

    There are several different ways of designing a sample. The one presented in Dryer (1989) is <strong>a Genus-Macroarea method</strong>, further developed by Miestamo et al. (2016). This method deals with the differing depth of genealogical groupings and the problem of macroareas. Dryer (1989) suggests a concept of <strong><i>genus</i></strong>, a cluster of languages with a time depth of separation in the area of about 3500 to 4000 years. Therefore, taking into sample one language per genus, a typologist controls genealogical bias. Also, Dryer (1989) assumes the existence of continent-sized areas of contact — <strong><i>macroareas</i></strong><sup><a id="fn-1" href="#1">1</a></sup>. Miestamo et al. (2016) calculates a number of genera that needs to be taken from different areas with the respect to the percentage that each macroarea represents of the total number of genera (the numbers are presented for different presupposed sample sizes). On this site, you are able to build a <i>primary sample</i> in Miestamo et al.'s terms, i.e., genealogical diversity of every macroarea is equally represented and the sample size is predetermined (top-down variant). Still, you can apply some filters to this primary sample (see the page <a href="/manual">Manual</a>).

    <strong>Diversity Value sampling method</strong> was introduced by Rijkhoff et al. (1993). This method is based on genealogical classification. The <strong><i>diversity value (DV)</i></strong> is a measure of a genealogical grouping that marks its internal diversity. It is calculated on the basis of the node structure of a genealogical grouping. The higher the DV, the higher the probability of including a language from this grouping in the sample (if the sample size is less than the number of all genealogical groupings) or the higher the number of languages from this grouping that will be included in the sample (if the sample size is more than the number of all genealogical groupings). That means, the complexity of a tree structure is taken as an internal variety marker rather than the number of languages in the grouping.

    This site is built for typologists who want flexible, data-driven tools. Using databases by <a href='https://glottolog.org/'>Glottolog</a> — the most comprehensive catalogue of the world's languages — it lets you create your own custom samples. Choose <strong>your</strong> sampling method, sample size, macroareas, and description language. Discover the full range of customization options on the <a href="/">Make a Sample</a> page.

    In the original article the list of macroareas is as follows: Africa, Eurasia, Australia-New Guinea, North America, and South America. However, on this site we follow the distinction proposed in Glottolog (Hammarström et al. 2024).
