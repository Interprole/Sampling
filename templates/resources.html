<p> <b>Sample</b> is a subset of languages that typologists use to study cross-linguistic variation. 
   There are two types of samples that pursue different goals. 
   The first type, <b>variety sample</b>, is aimed to capture all the linguistic diversity. 
   In other words, this sample is used to study what language <b>can</b> do. 
   The second one, <b>probability sample</b>, deals with statistical testing of tendencies and correlations. 
   Otherwise spoken, one should use this sample to study what language is <b>more likely</b> to do.

   There are several different ways of designing a sample. 
   The one presented in Dryer (1989) is a <b>Genus-Macroarea method</b>, further developed by Miestamo et al. (2016). 
   This method deals with the differing depth of genealogical groupings and the problem of macroareas. 
   Dryer (1989) suggests a concept of <b><i>genus</i></b>, a cluster of languages with a time depth of separation in the area of about 3500 to 4000 years. 
   Therefore, taking into sample one language per genus, a typologist controls genealogical bias. 
   Also, Dryer (1989) assumes the existence of continent-sized areas of contact — <b><i>macroareas</i></b>. 
   Miestamo et al. (2016) calculates a number of genera that needs to be taken from different areas with the respect to the percentage that each macroarea represents of the total number of genera (the numbers are presented for different presupposed sample sizes).
